## Overview

The **Flow Connection Reference Mapper** is a [XRMToolBox](https://www.xrmtoolbox.com/) plugin developed to provide administrators and developers with a means to inspect & bulk reassign connection references on Power Automate flows. It is primarily designed to reduce the administrative burden of manually updating connection references from user-owned accounts to service principals or system accounts, aligning with governance best practices and organizational security policies.

Use this tool to:
- Audit connection references across multiple flows
- Efficiently reassign Power Automate Flow connection references within a solution or at an environment level
